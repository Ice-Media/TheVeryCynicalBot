This is a Discord bot that was made by a small group of people for a friend.


If you want to use this download and make a file in the main directory with index.js called "botconfig.json"


Inside it put this:
```
{
"token": "INSERT BOT TOKEN"
}
```
save it.

Then Shift-Click and open a Powersheel/Command Prompt and type "npm install discord.js"
After it finishes type "npm install -g nodemon"

Once that is done close the window and double click the "start.bat" file.
